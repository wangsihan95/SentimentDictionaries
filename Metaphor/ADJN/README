Adjective-Noun metaphors used for model training in the paper 

Metaphor Detection with Cross-Lingual Model Transfer (forthcoming)


We construct and make publicly available a training set containing 
884 metaphorical AN pairs and 884 pairs with literal meaning. 
It was collected by two annotators using public resources 
(collections of metaphors on the web).
At least one additional person carefully examined and culled 
the collected metaphors, by removing duplicates, weak metaphors, 
and metaphorical phrases (such as drowning students) whose interpretation 
depends on the context.
