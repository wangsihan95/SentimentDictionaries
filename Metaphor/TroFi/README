We train the Subject-Verb-Object metaphor detection pipeline on the 
TroFi (Trope Finder) dataset (Birke and Sarkar, 2006) 
--http://natlang.cs.sfu.ca/software/trofi.html-- 
which includes 3,737 manually annotated English sentences 
from the  Wall Street Journal. Each sentence has an example of either 
literal or metaphorical use for one of the 50 English verbs.
